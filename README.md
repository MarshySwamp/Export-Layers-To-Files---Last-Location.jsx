To set the save path to be remembered, hold down the SHIFT key when running the script.Â The shift modifier key is only required to be run to set a new default save path. If the save location doesn't need to be changed, then the script only needs to be run without the shift key to continue to use the previously saved file path.

Run the script without the shift key depressed to use the saved location. If the save location is not explicitly set, the default location will be the active document path (as per the standard script). Unsaved source files will default to a blank save location (as per the standard script).

It is advised that the original script has a backup copy made before being removed and replaced with this custom version.
