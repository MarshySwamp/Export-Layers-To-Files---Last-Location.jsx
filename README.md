To set the save path to be remembered, hold down the SHIFT key when running the script. Run the script a second time without the shift key depressed to use the saved location. If the save location is not explicitly set, the default location will be the active document path (as per the standard script). Unsaved source files will default to a blank save location (as per the standard script).
